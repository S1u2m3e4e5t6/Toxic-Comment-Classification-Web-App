This project is an NLP-based machine learning model designed to classify text messages or comments as either **Toxic** or **Not Toxic**. The model is built using Python and Scikit-learn and is trained on a dataset of Wikipedia comments.

## ✨ Features

-   Processes and cleans raw text data for machine learning.
-   Uses **TF-IDF** (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for feature extraction.
-   Trained with a **Logistic Regression** classifier, a reliable and efficient model for text classification.
-   Achieves approximately **95% accuracy** on the test set.

## 🚀 Quick Demo

You can use the trained model to classify new sentences with a simple function.

**Code:**
```python
# --- Example Usage ---
predict_toxicity("you are a wonderful person and I love your content")
predict_toxicity("go away you are the worst person ever")
predict_toxicity("I will find you and hurt you")
```
Output:

'you are a wonderful person and I love your content' -> Prediction: Not Toxic 😊
'go away you are the worst person ever'            -> Prediction: Toxic 😡
'I will find you and hurt you'                      -> Prediction: Toxic 😡

## 🛠️ Technology Stack
Python: The core programming language.

Pandas: For data loading and manipulation.

NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit): For text cleaning, stop word removal, and lemmatization.

Scikit-learn: For machine learning, including TF-IDF, model training, and evaluation.

Google Colab: As the development environment to bypass local permission issues and leverage cloud computing power.



## ⚙️ Getting Started
This project is designed to be run easily in Google Colab, which requires no local setup.

1. Open in Colab

Click the button below to open the notebook directly in Google Colab.

(Note: Replace the link above with the actual link to your .ipynb file in your GitHub repository.)

2. Upload the Dataset

Download the train.csv file from the Kaggle Toxic Comment Classification Challenge.

In your Colab notebook, click the folder icon on the left, then click the upload button and select your train.csv file.

3. Run the Cells

Execute the cells in the notebook from top to bottom. The script will handle everything from data loading and cleaning to model training and evaluation.

## 📊 Model Performance & Analysis
The model was trained on 100,000 comment samples and achieved the following results on the test set:

Classification Report:
```

              precision    recall  f1-score   support

   Not Toxic       0.96      0.99      0.97     17983
       Toxic       0.92      0.58      0.72      2017

    accuracy                           0.95     20000
   macro avg       0.94      0.79      0.84     20000
weighted avg       0.95      0.95      0.95     20000
```

Analysis:

The model shows high precision (0.92) for the "Toxic" class, meaning its positive predictions are usually correct. However, the recall is low (0.58), indicating that it fails to identify a significant number of toxic comments. This is a common challenge with imbalanced datasets and is the primary area for future work.

## 🌱 Future Improvements
Improve Recall for the 'Toxic' Class: The main goal is to improve the model's ability to detect toxic comments without significantly harming precision. This could be achieved by:

Using advanced techniques like SMOTE to handle class imbalance.

Experimenting with more complex models like LSTM or Transformer-based architectures (e.g., BERT).

Of course. The README you have is already very good—it's detailed, honest about the model's limitations, and well-structured. We can make it even better by improving the user experience, professional look, and flow of information.

Here is a refined and more polished version that you can use.

1. Professional Badges: Shuru mein badges (License, Python, Framework) daale gaye hain, jo project ko ek standard look dete hain.
2. "Open in Colab" Button: Yeh sabse bada sudhaar hai. Sirf "code copy-paste karo" kehne se behtar hai ki aap user ko seedha ek button de dein jisse woh aapka project Google Colab mein khol sake. Isse aapka project istemal karna bahut aasan ho jaata hai.
3.  Streamlined Demo: `Making Predictions` aur `Example Output` sections ko ek `Quick Demo` section mein jod diya gaya hai. Yeh redundancy ko kam karta hai aur naye user ko turant dikhata hai ki aapka project kya karta hai.
4.  Behtar Flow: Jaankari ko ek logical flow mein rakha gaya hai: Project kya hai -> Kya kar sakta hai (Demo) -> Kaise banaya gaya hai (Tech Stack) -> Kaise istemal karein (Getting Started) -> Kitna achha kaam karta hai (Performance) -> Aage kya hoga (Improvements).
5.  Dedicated 'Future Improvements' Section: Model ki kamiyon ko ek opportunity ki tarah "Future Improvements" section mein daalna ek bahut hi professional approach hai.
6.  Clearer Instructions: "Getting Started" section ab zyaada saaf aur actionable hai.
